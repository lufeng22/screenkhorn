    "> In the automotive domain, many ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) integrate cameras for collision avoidance with pedestrians. A prototype of such functionality is described in [1]. An ADAS camera system detects risks from surrounding objects, provides warning to the driver and allows pre-crash actions to be performed automatically by the vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this context, the SCSM (Stereoscopic Camera Sensor Module) ensures precise detection of distance and 3D reconstruction. The SCSM system is composed of both optical components such as lenses and electronic components such as CMOS sensors. The system designer has to combine optical parameters (focal length, camera position) and CMOS sensor choice to find the best trade-off architectures. These architectures should minimize total hardware cost and maximize performance for a given situation. Reference [2] presents an approach for obstacle detection using stereoscopic sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Fig. 1 shows the considered situation for the SCSM and the environment. The left and right CMOS sensors are represented by two oblique planes Sl and Sr called the views. In this representation, the horizontal planes represent the road and the vertical ones represent obstacles. A nearby and a distant obstacle are respectively figured by the ball and by the pedestrian. We expect the lenses and the sensors to be identical between the left and right views."
